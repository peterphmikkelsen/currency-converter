# Currency Converter
My first attempt at an iOS app written in Swift. This app is simply written for learning purposes and because I was tired of ads on every single currency converter app I could find! It is definitely not my finest work 😅 but it works 🤷‍♂️.

I wanted to write an app that I could actually use (which I do) and at the same time learn about Swift, SwiftUI and the Apple Developer ecosystem (you have to pay Apple to keep the app working for more than a week!? 🤯).
And to my surprise Swift is actually very nice to use, even though my code is horrible to look at 😅

## How it looks
Simple but effective
